**Errors in Lubuntu**

```
Error:
Failed to execute child process "xterm" (No such file or directory)

Solution:
1) Open terminal
2) $cd /usr/bin
3) sudo cp lxterminal xterm

Why:
xterm is not found, and it cannot execute the terminal to open in that folder.
To do so, we copy paste lxterminal and change it to xterm.
```
